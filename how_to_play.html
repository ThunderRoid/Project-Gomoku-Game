        <h4>Rules for Gomoku</h4>
        <p>Gomoku also called Gobang or Five in a Row, it is traditionally played with Go pieces (black
            and white stones) on a Go board, using 15×15 of the 19×19 grid intersections. As pieces are not moved or
            removed from the board, Gomoku may also be played as a paper and pencil game. The game is known in
            several countries under different names.
        </p>
        <p>Black plays first, and players alternate in placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The
            winner is the first player to get an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
